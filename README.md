![Social Media Filter](social_media_filter.jpg)

This repository contains the code for an impactful project aimed at creating a powerful social media filter to combat harmful or offensive content on social media platforms. The filter is built upon a sophisticated machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of harmful or offensive content.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

Once you have the required dependencies installed, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/social-media-filter.git`.
2. Open the `main.py` file in a Python IDE of your choice.
3. Set the `FILTER_TYPE` variable to the desired type of filter (e.g., harmful content, offensive language, etc.).
4. Run the `main.py` file.

## Results

The project will generate compelling images and videos showcasing the filter in action as it effectively removes harmful or offensive content from social media platforms. All media files will be saved to the `results` directory within the repository.
